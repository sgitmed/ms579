    <h1> <center>Ethics in Software Design</center></h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic;"><center>UX and UI are integral aspects of the software development process. Ultimately, the goal of
        developers is to create functional applications that appeal to and engage users.
        Applications which lack comprehensive UX and UI design may fail to generate such engagement,
        and as a result, revenue.<br>
        An ethical concern surrounding software design comes from the abilities for developers to craft
        applications that can exploit psychological patterns and user behavior. This website focuses on
        dark patterns and addictive design, both crafted for the benefit of the company and detriment of the user.

                Coined by Harry Brignull, a dark pattern is a "manipulative
                or deceptive trick in software that gets users to complete an
                action that they would otherwise not have done, if they had understood
                it or had a choice at the time" (2021). <br><br>These design choices exploit
                user psychology to help benefit a company or organizations. Dark or
                deceptive software design patterns often involve deceptive marketing,
                emotional manipulation, and difficulty of navigation.

                Addictive design elements are frequently used in social media, mobile games,
                and a number of other digital applications. Addictive design elements often 
                aim to keep users engaged within the application for as long as possible. 
                <br><br>
                While one of the key goals of UX and UI designers is to ensure their audience
                is engaging with the app often for long durations of time, developers must be 
                cognizant of the impacts of their design choices and balance engagement strategies
                with ethics.

                Ethical considerations surrounding software design move to prioritize user well-being over 
                organizational profits. There are three key areas of consideration including:<ul><li>Manipulation of user autonomy</li><br><li>Exploitation of psychological vulnerabilities</li><br><li>Impact on mental heath</li></ul>
